- performs the following operations to the archive data described below.

 The following script is used to manipulate and summarize data collected 
 from 30 subjects, performing a variety of activities while wearing a
 Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. Measurements were sampled from the embedded
 accelerometers of devices worn by the subjects.

 A full description is available from the UCI archive available here: 
 http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

 For more information about the dataset contact: activityrecognition@smartlab.ws

 Relavant files from the archive used for data processing:
 activity_labesl.txt   - key id to activity name cross-reference
 features.txt          - key id to data field lablel cross-reference

 X_train.txt           - training subjects measured and calculated data
 y_train.txt           - training subjects activity id numbers
 subject_train.txt     - training subject id numbers

 X_test.txt            - training subjects measured and calculated data
 y_test.txt            - training subjects activity id numbers
 subject_test.txt      - training subject id numbers

 This script performs the following operations:  
      - 1. Merges training and test data files above into a single dataframe.  
       - 2. Extracts mean and standard deviation measurements only based on feature list.  
       - 3. Replaces activity identifiers with activity labels from the key/label file.  
       - 4. Creates variable names labels consistent with original feature list.  
       - 5. Arranges the data by subject id  
       - 6. Stores result in dataframe, data.  
       - 7. Creates dataframe summary_avgs from data with the averages for each variable
          for each activity and subject.  

 This script generates two output dataframes, data and summary_avgs. These 
 dataframes have the following contents:  
 **data**                  - 10299 x 81 dataframe
                         subject id, activity, 79 measurement variables of mean and
                         standard deviations collected or computed from accelerometer 
                         data.  
 
 **summary_avgs**          - 180 x 81 dataframe
                         subject id, activity, average value of each variable for each 
                         activity and for each subject.

#####CodeBook.md  
-  code book that describes the variables within the data set, a brief description of how run_analysis. R processes that data set.
